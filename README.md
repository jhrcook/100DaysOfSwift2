End Date: June 28, 2020**


## Plan

**My goal for this 100 days is to build an iOS application.**
It will be an application that helps me monitor my seedlings, helping me track their growth and my thoughts along the way.
I want it to be built well, have some key finctionalities, and be avilable on the iOS App Store.

To this end, I will first refresh myself with iOS app development by following some tutorials from [Hacking with iOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read), particularly those that touch on API's and tehcniques I hope to incorporate into my app.
I will then follow the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) tutorials so that I can create my application using the modern Apple framework.
Finally, I will pursue additional tutorials to fill in the gaps, such as testing and using instruments effectively.
