**Start Date: March 20, 2020  
End Date: June 28, 2020**


## Plan

**My goal for this 100 days is to build an iOS application.**
It will be an application that helps me monitor my seedlings, helping me track their growth and my thoughts along the way.
I want it to be built well, have some key finctionalities, and be avilable on the iOS App Store.

To this end, I will first refresh myself with iOS app development by following some tutorials from [Hacking with iOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read), particularly those that touch on API's and tehcniques I hope to incorporate into my app.
I will then follow the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) tutorials so that I can create my application using the modern Apple framework.
Finally, I will pursue additional tutorials to fill in the gaps, such as testing and using instruments effectively.


### Tutorials to do:

1. Hacking with Swift - [Project 9: Grand Central Dispatch](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/9/overview)
2. Hacking with Swift - [Project 12: UserDefaults](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/12/overview)
3. Hacking with Swift - [Project 15: Animation](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/15/overview)
4. Hacking with Swift - [Project 21: Local Notifications](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/21/overview)
5. Hacking with Swift - [Project 30: Instruments](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/30/overview)
6. Hacking with Swift - [Project 32: SwiftSearcher](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/32/overview)
7. Hacking with Swift - [Project 38: GitHub Commits](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/38/overview)
8. Hacking with Swift - [Project 39: Unit testing with XCTest](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/39/overview)
9. [100 Days of Swift UI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
10. Swift Package Manager

## Log


**Day 1 - March 20, 2020:**
I got a refresher on Grand Central Dispatch from Hacking with Swift.

**Day 2 - March 21, 2020:**
A good refresher on using UserDefaults and Codable from Hacking with Swift.

**Day 3 - March 22, 2020:**
I reviewed Project 15 on Animation from Hacking with Swift.

**Day 4 - March 23, 2020:**
A good refresher on local notifications from HAcking with Swift.

**Day 5 - March 25, 2020:**
I began working on the GitHub Commmits project to learn about CoreData.
I didn't finish it (it is dense), but pasued at 'Time for some useful code' on page 4 of the tutorial.

**Day 6 - March 26, 2020:**
I learned even more about CoreData as I continue through the Hacking with Swift project.
I'm taking my time and making sure I understand each step because I would really like to use it in my app.

**Day 7 - March 30, 2020:**
I finished the CoreDate tutorial from Hacking with Swift and am planning to do a prototype app to further practice using CoreData.

**Day 8 - March 31, 2020:**
I began work on my CoreData demo app.
It is at the repository jhrcook/CoreDataDemo2.
I am walkign through Apple's guides and haven't gotten lost (yet).

**Day 9 - April 01, 2020:**
I have CoreData up and running! I need to do some adjusting to the UI before going much further, but I am feeling confident.
